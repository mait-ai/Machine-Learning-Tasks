# The Rise of the WeatherMind — Agentic AI Using LangGraph

## Task Summary
This project involves constructing an intelligent agent system using LangGraph. The agent, called **WeatherMind**, integrates an LLM (via Groq) with external tools like a calculator, weather API, and fashion trend recommender.

## Notebook Overview

### Task 2 — Levels Breakdown

#### Level 1: Awakening WeatherMind
- Installed dependencies (`langgraph`, `langsmith`, `langchain_groq`).
- Created a `chatbot` node using a Groq-powered LLM.
- Integrated a BODMAS-compliant `calculator` tool.
- Visualized the LangGraph structure using image rendering.

##  Files Included
- `WeatherMindTask.ipynb`: Full LangGraph agent development notebook.
- `WeatherMind_Report.pdf`: PDF report outlining the architecture and experiments.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python, LangGraph, LangChain, Groq, OpenAI/Gemini API, Requests

## Notes
- Each agent and tool is modular and extensible.
- Graph-based reasoning is visualized for clarity.
- Memory and multi-agent collaboration are implemented successfully.
